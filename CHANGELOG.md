## Autoethnographic reflections

### JS

#### Liked
* Was able to discern the structure of the paddle
* Could see the ball come towards him
* Colour contrast worked for him

#### Improvements
* Could not see the red line that guides the person to pick up the paddle at all.
* Could not pick up the paddle or play.
* Wanted a button for direct pickup.
* Wanted a menu for changing contrasts based on preference.
* Wanted audio cues for guidance.
* Continuous sound inclusion

Not yet accessible for totally blind individuals.

### OK

#### Liked
* Could easily make out the paddle.
* Liked a white border to the upper section and a white handle.
* Could see the red line to aim at the paddle
* Could hit the ball, since he could see it coming.
* Liked the ‘pop’ sound generated when the person hit the ball instead of the paddle

Found it much more accessible to low-vision individual than previous internal version.

#### Improvements
* Would have liked the continuous sound to be included as well.
