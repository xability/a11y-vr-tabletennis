Accessible Virtual Reality Exercise Game with and for Blind and Low-vision People

## VR Exergames for BLV Users

This project aims to develop a VR game with sound and haptic feedback systems specifically designed for blind and low-vision (BLV) users.

### Project Objectives

* Design and develop a VR exergame that motivates physical activity and exercise for BLV users.
* Implement immersive sound and haptic feedback systems that provide clear and intuitive cues for gameplay.

### Project Plan

The project is divided into the following phases:

* **February (Kickoff and Parallel Development):**
    * Establish project objectives, roles, and initial design concepts.
    * Begin parallel development of sound and haptic feedback systems.
    * Conduct initial sound design, focusing on basic game interactions and environmental cues.
    * Design and prototype haptic feedback patterns for various game elements.
* **March (Advanced Development and Integration):**
    * Enhance sound and haptic systems with complexity and variations.
    * Integrate sound and haptic feedback with the VR environment for initial testing.
* **April (AI Development and System Integration):**
    * Implement appropriate contrasts and audio cues.
    * Conduct comprehensive internal testing.
* **May (Feedback Incorporation):**
    * Conduct focus group sessions for development and iteration with our mixed ability team.
    * Analyze feedback and make necessary adjustments.
    * Prepare for project completion.
* **June (Final Adjustments and Conclusion):**
    * Implement final adjustments and complete documentation.
    * Host a project debrief and presentation.

### Current Progress
The current implementation of this game has a high contrast background with features to help BLV people (see), hear and feel the ball coming towards the player.
