## VR Exergames for BLV Users

This project aims to develop a VR game with sound and haptic feedback systems specifically designed for blind and low-vision (BLV) users, incorporating an AI opponent that responds realistically to player actions.

### Project Objectives

* Design and develop a VR exergame that motivates physical activity and exercise for BLV users.
* Implement immersive sound and haptic feedback systems that provide clear and intuitive cues for gameplay.
* Integrate an AI opponent that adapts its behavior based on player actions and feedback.

### Project Plan

The project is divided into the following phases:

* **February (Kickoff and Parallel Development):**
    * Establish project objectives, roles, and initial design concepts.
    * Begin parallel development of sound and haptic feedback systems.
    * Conduct initial sound design, focusing on basic game interactions and environmental cues.
    * Design and prototype haptic feedback patterns for various game elements.
* **March (Advanced Development and Integration):**
    * Enhance sound and haptic systems with complexity and variations.
    * Integrate sound and haptic feedback with the VR environment for initial testing.
* **April (AI Development and System Integration):**
    * Develop the AI opponent with responsive behaviors to player actions.
    * Integrate the AI opponent with the sound and haptic feedback systems.
    * Conduct comprehensive internal testing.
* **May (Beta Testing and Feedback Incorporation):**
    * Conduct beta testing with BLV users.
    * Analyze feedback and make necessary adjustments.
    * Prepare for project completion.
* **June (Final Adjustments and Conclusion):**
    * Implement final adjustments and complete documentation.
    * Host a project debrief and presentation.

### Current Progress

* Week 1 (Feb 6-13):
    * Conducted research on haptic gloves and ambisonic sound design.
    * Set up GitHub and Slack accounts.
    * Participated in team introductions.
    * Initiated work on procedural audio generation.
    * Optimized existing game files.
* Week 2 (Feb 14-21):
    * Fixed game crashing and SteamVR build issues.
    * Migrated to Unity's OpenXR rig.
    * Explored procedural sound generation using Unity's OnAudioFilterRead method.
    * Implemented static soundscapes with Unity's ambisonic system and custom sound library.
